/** The purpose of this class is to store a list of IP-Addresses. If an
IP-Address is inserted more than 'x' times, than an error is returned.
The First mix uses this functionalty to do some basic Denial Of Service defense.
If someone tries to do connection flooding to the First Mix, only 'x' connections
are accepted and the others are droped. 
The internal organisation is a hash-table with overrun lists. The hashtable has
0x10000 buckets. The last two bytes of an IP-Address are the hash-key.
@note This class only supports IPv4.
@warning If there is less memory, CAIPList will crash!
